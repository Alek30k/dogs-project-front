# dogs-project-front

Hi! I'd like to introduce console.Dog(), a digital dog breed encyclopedia that I developed as my Individual Project in #HENRY 'S Bootcamp.

In this SPA you will: 

Access through a landing page. View a display of 8 cards per page, each showing a preview of selected details in the "Home page". Navigate different pages thanks to a pagination or go back and forth with a previous and next button. Sort the cards alphabetically or by dog weight. Filter by temperaments (you may sort within the filters as well). Filter by API breeds and created breeds. Search by breed in a controlled search bar. Access a specific card to view extra details. Add to favourites by clicking the heart icon on the card. In the "Favourites page" you can: see your favourite dogs and delete the ones you don't like anymore. In the "Create page" you can create a new breed through a controlled form, save it to the data base and delete it later if you regret the Frankenstein.
